"""Identity Platform blocking function — domain gate + role claims (T07, ADR-024).

Two HTTPS endpoints deployed from this package (gen2 Cloud Functions,
operator runbook: ``specs/021-t07-identity-sso/quickstart.md`` §4):

- ``before_created`` (``beforeUserCreated``): blocks account creation for
  non-``n-ix.com`` / unverified emails; injects persistent ``hd`` (+ ``role``
  when mapped) custom claims.
- ``before_signed_in`` (``beforeUserSignedIn``): re-derives the same claims
  on EVERY sign-in as session claims, so a role change in
  ``configs/auth-roles.yaml`` (redeployed with the function) takes effect at
  the next sign-in — no persistent stale claims (research R2).

The ``firebase_functions`` SDK implements the blocking-function wire
protocol, including verification of the GCIP-signed request JWT — the
endpoints are deployed ``--allow-unauthenticated`` because Identity Platform
is the caller and the payload signature is the authentication (research R7).

The role mapping is a vendored copy of ``configs/auth-roles.yaml`` placed
next to this file by the deploy step. A missing/invalid mapping raises at
cold start: sign-ins fail loudly (fail-closed) rather than admitting anyone.

This module is intentionally a thin adapter: all decision logic lives in
:mod:`roles` (pure, repo-unit-tested). It imports ``firebase_functions``,
which exists only in the function runtime (``requirements.txt`` here) — the
repo test suite never imports this module.
